## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Here's a glimpse of the features and improvements planned for future iterations of this personal website:

- **Performance & SEO Enhancements:** Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) techniques
  to boost initial load times and improve search engine visibility.
- **Contact Form Integration:** Develop and integrate a functional contact form to allow visitors to easily get in
  touch.
- **Blogging Feature:** Add a dedicated blog section to share insights, tutorials, and thoughts, complete with
  commenting functionality.
- **Dedicated Content Pages:** Create specific, richly detailed pages for "Experience" and "Projects" to provide more
  in-depth information.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Introduce a chatbot to answer common user questions about my profile, skills, and projects,
  enhancing user engagement.
- **Enhanced Interactive Features using WebSockets:** Explore real-time functionalities like real-time chat for contact,
  or live notifications for new content/activity.
- **Advanced AI Integrations:** Implement AI capabilities such as semantic search for site content, or more
  sophisticated language understanding within the chatbot.
- **Expanded Serverless Functionality:** Leverage more serverless functions (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) for specific
  microservices or API endpoints.
- **Potential Dedicated Backend:** Explore the possibility of building a dedicated backend from scratch using Java
  Spring, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), a database, and microservices architecture, if complex dynamic features
  are required.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Capabilities:** Implement PWA features to make my website installable on devices,
  offer
  offline access (for static content), and provide a more app-like experience.
  This can significantly improve user retention and accessibility.
- **Advanced Animations & Micro-interactions:** Beyond basic element animations, add subtle, thoughtful
  micro-interactions (e.g., hover effects on cards, click feedback) and more advanced, performance-optimized
  animations (e.g., using libraries like GSAP) to make the user interface more delightful and engaging.
- **Comprehensive Accessibility Audit & Statement:** Conduct a thorough audit against WCAG guidelines and consider
  publishing an accessibility statement on my site.
  This demonstrates a strong commitment to inclusive design and makes my website usable by the widest possible audience.
- **Automated Testing Reports/Badges:** Consider displaying test
  coverage (unit, integration, E2E) badges in `README.md` or even a simple test report page on my site.
  This showcases your commitment to quality.
- **Performance Budgeting:** As I add more features, define and continuously monitor a "performance budget" (e.g., max
  JavaScript size, load time, number of requests) to ensure my site remains fast and responsive.
